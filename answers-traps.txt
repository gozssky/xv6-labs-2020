1. Which registers contain arguments to functions?

a0, a1, a2

  For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?

a2

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? 
  Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)

There is no call to function before functions are all inlined.

3. At what address is the function printf located?

0x628

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?

0x38

5. Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
What is the output?

HE110 World

The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian.
If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output?
0x726c64

Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
No

6. In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? 
  (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);

It depends on register value.
